            <p>PogiUpdates3: Nothing much happened today. I read the new comic book I got and I definitely loved the art and story.
                One noteable detail I loved about it was how the art glows just by looking at it. Other than that, I studied for a bit
                and went for a 20km walk and a 5km jog. That's about as interesting as it got.
