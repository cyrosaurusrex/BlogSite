            <p>PogiUpdates4: My whole lower body hurts. Maybe going for a 20km walk and a 5km jog was too much for my body.
                I spent the rest of the day recovering and more studying for upcoming quizes. There was also one lab activity for 
                IM that took me the whole day to finish. I passed it 1 hour before the deadline, luckily I finished it on time. Anyway, I'm starting to miss the gym.
                 That's all.
