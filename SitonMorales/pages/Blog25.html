            <p class="box-text">I enjoyed the fact that I didn't have to commute today and could stay in my room for a bit longer. Today is the start of our asynchronous classes, meaning I have the flexibility to work at my own pace. The shift in learning modality is because of the EDSA People Power Revolution anniversary. I took some time this morning to reflect and understand about what truly happened during those revolution in 1986. It’s important to stay aware of the Philippine History and the sacrifices made for the democracy that we currently have. Learning about the past makes me realize how lucky we are to have our freedom today.</p>
            <p class="box-text">I shifted my focus back to my academic responsibilities after my period of reflection. I currently have three deadlines for this week. I thought that it is too heavy for me to do all that at once so I focused only on one task. I finished it by late afternoon. Completing that first task has lowered my stress levels over the schoolwork that I need to submit by the next two days. Now that the biggest task is out of the way, I feel much more confident about finishing everything else on time.</p>
