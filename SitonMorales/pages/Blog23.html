            <p class="box-text">I set my alarm last night at 4am, to wake up extra early and review the fundamental concepts for our upcoming Web Systems and Technologies quiz. I managed to review three major topics by 7 am. I initially felt a bit overwhelmed but after a few cups of coffee, the concepts started to click. Actually, I thought that the quiz was at 8 am until I asked my classmate if there's a morning class. They clarified that the WST quiz will be at 1 pm. I felt a huge relief because I still have time to review and study.</p>
            <p class="box-text">Since I had some extra time and my brain was a bit fried because of the study session, I decided to sleep for a few hours. After waking up again at 10 am, I spent my morning helping with house chores. I even made sure to shower so I will feel fresh for the afternoon exam. But our prof, Ma’am Jevah, announced that the quiz was suspended. Since my schedule suddenly cleared up, I was able to attend my little brother’s communion ceremony at our local church. It started at 1pm up until 2:30 pm. It was a heart-warming experience to see him becoming more inclined toward his faith and strengthening his relationship with God. I am glad I was there to witness him on such a special day.</p>
