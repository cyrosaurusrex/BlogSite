            <p class="box-text">I started my morning with a clear plan to finish all my pending requirements. I dedicated most of my day to the second activity that is due before midnight. That's why I stopped scrolling on social media and kept my phone in the drawer to focus entirely on the task. It was hard at first but I really needed to stay away from distractions to get things done. I need to submit these activities before deadline so I won't have to deal with the stress that comes with late submissions. I feel much lighter knowing I won't be rushing at the last minute tonight.</p>
            <p class="box-text">Aside from the schoolwork, it has been a pretty pleasant day. I stepped away from my desk for a while. Then, I ate my mother's home-cooked lunch and some of my favorite snacks while sitting by the window. The breeze outside made the moment feel very peaceful and calm. Having even a bit of me-time really helped me keep the energy up while I re-reading and re-checking the task that I made. After a final look at my work, everything seemed to be in order. I felt good about the quality of work I made today!</p>
