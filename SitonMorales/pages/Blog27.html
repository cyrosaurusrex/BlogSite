            <p class="box-text">Since it is the weekend, I decided to take a break from my laptop screen and fix my surroundings. Today was all about doing the adulting tasks that I am starting to forget because of my busy school week. I spent my afternoon doing laundry, starting it by 1:00 pm and getting everything done by 4:00 pm. It was a lot of clothes but I managed to finish it all before the sun went down. There’s something therapeutic about finishing chores and seeing a clean space, especially after a week full of coding and quizzes. My room finally feels organized and fresh again.</p>
            <p class="box-text">After the chores, I gave myself some time to fully recharge and ignore other responsibilities for a while. I didn't want to think about something stressful today. I ended the saturday on a high note by playing with Chuckie, one of my dogs. He was so happy and kept jumping around which made me laugh and forget about my stress. Then, I slept on bed feeling refreshed and ready for the new challenges and tasks Monday might bring. I'm hoping for another productive week ahead.</p>
