            <p class="box-text">I prepared my uniform and bag early because I didn't want to be late for my class. I'll spent most of my day on campus since we have face-to-face classes. I started my commute around 8:30 am to make it on my 10 am Networking class. Usually, traffic occurs at this time of the day but luckily the road is clear so I arrived way earlier than I expected. The class session turned out good as we talked about the Transport Layer, comparing TCP and UDP. We also checked our previous quiz results. I am glad and satisfied with my score. I can see my late-night study sessions paying off. It gave me a lot of motivation to keep working hard for the rest of the semester.</p>
            <p class="box-text">By the afternoon, the weather was hot that it started to make me feel uncomfortable. I went to the University Library to prepare for the Information Management quiz. However, it ended up being postponed due to my professor’s sudden commitment. So I took the opportunity to take a picture of our chosen thesis topic to analyze for our Information Management Activity. After that, I headed home early to beat the rush hour. I spent the rest of the day relaxing on the bed and reading few articles that served as my mental reset. It was a long day, but getting home early made it much better.</p>
